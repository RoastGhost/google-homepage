This project is a static google homepage remake that I did for practice. To be more specific, breaking up the page in sections with divs and calling specific elements and ID's out in css to modify their exact position to get as close to the original as possible. Insertion of svg's into the div's was also an interesting practice. Undergoing this small project has allowed me to freshen up my HTML and CSS as I hope to one day land a job as a web-developer.
